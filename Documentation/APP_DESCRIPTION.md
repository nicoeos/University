# Too Crous To Go

## 🌍 Mission
**Too Crous To Go** is a dedicated food rescue platform designed specifically for the university ecosystem in Strasbourg. 
By connecting Crous cafeterias and university restaurants with students, we aim to eliminate food waste while 
providing affordable meals to those who need them most.

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Students (The Rescuers)
Students can browse "Mystery Bags" available at various Crous locations across the campus.
1.  **Browse:** View active offers from nearby university restaurants (Resto U', Cafeterias).
2.  **Filter:** Select preferences based on location and diet (Vegetarian, Halal, Snacks, Meals).
3.  **Reserve:** Secure a bag for a fraction of the original price (typically €1 - €3).
4.  **Collect:** Show the QR code at the restaurant during the specific pickup window.
5.  **Track:** Monitor personal impact through the "Meals Saved" dashboard.

### For Crous Managers (The Partners)
Restaurant managers have a dedicated portal to manage surplus inventory efficiently.
1.  **Upload:** Quickly post "Mystery Bags" with predefined categories and quantities.
2.  **Schedule:** Set specific pickup times to manage student flow during off-peak hours.
3.  **Analyze:** Track performance via a dashboard showing meals saved and revenue generated.
4.  **Impact:** Contribute directly to the university's sustainability goals.
